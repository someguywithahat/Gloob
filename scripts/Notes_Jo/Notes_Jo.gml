Notes go here:
If you need color swatches for anything import the pallet from "Slm_All_Base_donotuse - I made this file so I had an easy way of grabbing the starting slime animation for all the colors

So the numbers, I dont know if i like the font but its an atempt, it would be easy to copy and paste it into the files you have set up but i didnt want to change it without getting your input
If we do go with white numbers I would be interested in seeing how it looked with a slight random color shift to toher pastels in the green, yellow, tan color family like earth tones but super subtle

I started making trails but if i do it this way they would need to have a lot of pieces because direction maters because of light source, which im fine doing since Im being wierd about it but I wanted to see if i liked it before going to far into it.
I wasnt sure what made more senes for naming for you, I think of origin as from sprite so up would be up from the character but i thaught it would make more sense to use as movement so up is when you are moving up so thats how i have it now. 
As an alternative option I made 5 swatches "Spot_1-5" that i didnt know if you could use and overlap at random opacity and position to have the game generate a path using what you showed me the other night. If we go this route Im sure I would need to remake them once I see how it behaves but it may be interesting and allow you to play with things dispersing or fading in an interesting way. Reguardless of which Trail we go with I do plan on having it expose flowers as well like we discussed, theres still decisions to be made there. 

I would like to make a "character select" home screen even if it doesnt work yet, I want to name the colors cute things but i dont know hot to add text.
