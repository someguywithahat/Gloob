Notes go here:
If you need color swatches for anything import the pallet from "Slm_All_Base_donotuse - I made this file so I had an easy way of grabbing the starting slime animation for all the colors

Hardhat accesory-we should beable to go to the file and just set the other layers to not visable and use it as an overlay image but I set it this way for now so you can see the vision easier
The roll animation one is weird, we may need to discus how to make it work or i can just do it differant, see thr slm_grn_move file to see what i was going for.
go ahead and delete the extra frames from teh movement files so we can clean up the code, it will also make accessories easier later to not have extra frames to work around, if your real nervous duplicate it first and add _org for original so we have it for later but i think its better to have the files clean. I can do this too but then you need to do the code and i dont know what you are using, maybe its easier to do side by side or on discord call.
Now that we are doing the recolor thing we shoud probably discus our file names at some point, i think now that i get what is going to be needed we can get it more clear

Should teleport take your turn?
Modular sign parts?
unlockable goal?
unlockable powerups?
delete animation frames
letter outlines
