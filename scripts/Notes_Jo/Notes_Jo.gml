MENU PAGE NOTES
	I have most things set to x2 size, we can play with 1.5 or other things to help it look a little less cluttered but i thik this worked for general vibes
Title: 
	Slimes should form trail behind them and then it should fade right before they get back to it
	Clicking on the rainbow slime could enter a challange map that we uniqly build
	the slime jumping on the play sign can be a quick start to the last game played
	the slimes next to the score sign should grow/shrink or get more slimes as score goes up
	the number hanging from score can either be total points or your high score
Play:
	Click on slime use the light up animation from powerups to show selected
	arrow keys to flip through accessories (not actually hardhat and crown i just needed samples)
	click on rock! suprise rock play - ill work on it 
	
	Left sign is default game mode that you and i will decide on that scores points and high scores
	other signs can be overwritten with custom rules and saved so players can create thier own "defaults"
	if three is to much we can drop it to 2 and have a game (T TT) which would help the one stand out more
	icons: light/med/dark color for low med high setting, gold/gray for yes/no blue for custom
	click on icon can shuffle through quickly
	cusomize will take to custom detail page to get more specific
	save will let you rename and those options will be there in future games
	hover over little question to explain what icons / colors mean
	tutorial > How to play page > special mini safe map
	
Options:
	Left side is for map options that affect your game play style saved for specific map
	Right side is for global options that affect your entire game - these are more player preferances / accessibility things
	This is the page most likly to need a scroll function
	
	Grid size: Small medium large or custom grid size, i figure our default would be considered medium but maybe small cause its hard to imagine going much smaller
	numbers: number distributions being low normal or high. low would get rid of 8s and 9s and have more 2s and 3s show, high would get rid of 1s and 2s and have more 7s and 8s show
	pwerups: off, regular, high, custom
	obsticles: off, regular, high, custom
	Debating: weather / infinite
		weather: on / off or off, cosmetic, effects
		infinite: weather or not you can move to the next season
		i think i might want to combine these options tho because they are pretty closely linked and instead add music because if you make more music options it migh be fun to let people choose differant ones for differant maps
	
	people should be able to turn off the flowers as an "accessibilty" thing cause for some people they might be discracting or make reading hard
	if its possible to adjust font color and boldness at all, including like a default sans serif font for ease of reading
	
Scores:
	havent started much but will need to have high scores, the shop and village design, and a way to see achievments
	it would be nice if high scores had the date


DISCUSSED:
