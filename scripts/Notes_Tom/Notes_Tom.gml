/*

I had some ideas for sprites if you're feeling up to it.  These aren't important, but they sounded fun.

Sprite Request ideas:
	Cursor:			I can replace the windows cursor with a custom slime sprite cursor.  We could even animate it pretty easily.
	Trl_Grn_Spot:	A few more paterns of this sprite could be fun as this sprite gets used a lot.
