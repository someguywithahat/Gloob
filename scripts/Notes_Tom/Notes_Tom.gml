I had some ideas for sprites if you're feeling up to it.  These aren't important, but they sounded fun.

Sprite Request ideas:
	Cursor:			I can replace the windows cursor with a custom slime sprite cursor.  We could even animate it pretty easily.
	Trl_Grn_Spot:	A few more paterns of this sprite could be fun as this sprite gets used a lot.
	Different shapped obsticles:  A log that is 64x32, or a large rock that's 96x64 could be fun. 



Tom's upcoming TODO list:
	Redo total score calculation.  The current method is incredibly slow.  Difficaulty: 1/5
	
	Research and implement Sprite shaders so that we can use a single Gloop for everything.  This will dramatically simplify spriting. Difficaulty: 4/5
	
	Create a better menu system that can be called in game and dynamically controls all settings. Difficaulty: 5/5
		The menu will need different object types like sliders, toggles, and drop-downs. 
		The menu will need the ability to scroll.
		The menu might need different tabs. 
		The menu will need to pause the game.
	
	Fix bug were objects can spawn on other objects.  Difficaulty: 1/5
	
	Write improved melodies for the game.  Difficaulty: 4/5
